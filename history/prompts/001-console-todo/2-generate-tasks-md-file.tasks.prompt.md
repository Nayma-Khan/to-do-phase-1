  do read everything from the prompt history and make sure every task is done correctly and accurately.

  Context for task generation: do read everything from the prompt history and make sure every task is done correctly and accurately.

  The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.
response_text: |
  Successfully generated comprehensive tasks.md file for the Console Todo App feature based on all available design artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-contract.md, research.md, quickstart.md). The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing, following the required checklist format with proper task IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1-US5]. The structure follows the phased approach: Setup, Foundational, User Stories (prioritized), and Polish phases.
outcome: |
  Tasks successfully created and validated, following the required format and organization by user stories. Ready for implementation.
evaluation: |
  The generated tasks.md file follows all required specifications:
  - Tasks are in the correct format: - [ ] T### [P?] [US#] Description with file path
  - Organized by user stories enabling independent implementation and testing
  - Proper phase structure with dependencies clearly defined
  - Each task is specific enough for implementation without additional context
